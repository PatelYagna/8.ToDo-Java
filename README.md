# 8.ToDo-Java
This is an extremely simple todo list maker where a user can remove and add tasks.


In this program I created a todo list that can be improved upon. I wish to make this into a sort of gui if that's possible. Until now I've only been doing the programming assignments from school. I could upload those however they're really easy and provide most of the project's needs. This program is me applying what I have learned in school to my own projects. I will be expanding this over the course of time.

This week long break is for me to catch up with my github. It has been a while since I have visited github because I've mostly been focusing on school, college applications, and scholarships. I should be able to get some programs created, then improve them and use the older python programs to convert into Java.
